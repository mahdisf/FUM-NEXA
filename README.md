# FUM-NEXA
**The wearable robot FUM-NEXA (Knee Exoskeleton Assistance) ‎**
The ability to walk is a vital function directly related to our physical and psychological well-being. Walking abnormalities and impairments hurt our daily lives and could increase the chances of further medical complications. Patients with walking abnormalities must often undergo rehabilitative exercises to correct and improve their gait. To this end, the wearable ‎robot FUM-NEXA (Knee Exoskeleton Assistance) was designed to help patients with lower ‎limb disabilities restore or improve their walking ability and reduce the burden of human assistance.‎

FUM-NEXA consists of two 750/1498-watt BLDC motors with a precision gearbox, each driving a link placed on the human thigh and fastened with Velcro straps for either knee. The robot actuators are ‎designed to provide knee flexion torque during the gain cycle.‎
FUM-NEXA can perform all the needed algorithms to treat gait abnormality, reducing the physiotherapist’s ‎physical burden. Moreover, it helps to improve symmetric movement, stride, linear speed, and walking ‎duration.‎
